Todo

* - Priority
  
  [X] Build new service
    [X] Store timings
    [X] In memory cache of timings
    [X] Create cron jobs to spawn messages
   *[ ] Refresh cache on process restart
        - Why didn't I do this earlier?
        - Maybe refactor into better abstraction, just in memory cache
    [X] Edit: Should probably merge the API into the lyrics-service one
              Idk what to name it, kinda combines two concerns I guess
              This would let me use the same db connection/schema
              Maybe consider using nest to have a rock solid API layer
              But that would also mean all cron jobs are running in same thread
              Multithread?
  [X] Setup Storage
  [X] Enqueue messages
  [X] Dequeue messages in discord bot
  [X] Figure out command format
      - I know I can pass options, but how do I do cron syntax cleanly?
  [X] Better internal deps: packages?
      - Should internals be packages? Pain to `npm i` every repo, probably wrong
  [X] Better split services: app, discord, lyrics-runner
* [ ] Robustness
    - Discord bot needs help protecting itself
* [ ] Better logging
    - Can winston determine process name?
* [ ] Metrics
    - Open source version of data dog?
    - May be more work than value, get some sense of scale


[ ] - Load schedules from memory
[ ] - Discord cron input
[ ] - Buffer random lyrics
