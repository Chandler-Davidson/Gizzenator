Reoccurring Lyrics

# Big Idea!

Timing Service
  - api
    - endpoint to create new timing
    - endpoint to create webhook (optional since internal)
  - acts like an in memory cache w/ persistance
    - on startup, load all timings into memory
  - when a job fires, send it to the caller (likely only discord bot)
  
- should I use webhooks or create jobs in rabbitmq?


Todo List
[X] Build new service
  [X] Store timings
  [X] In memory cache of timings
  [X] Create cron jobs to spawn messages
  [ ] Refresh cache on process restart
  [ ] Edit: Should probably merge the API into the lyrics-service one
            Idk what to name it, kinda combines two concerns I guess
            This would let me use the same db connection/schema
            Maybe consider using nest to have a rock solid API layer
            But that would also mean all cron jobs are running in same thread
            Multithread?
[X] Setup Storage
[X] Enqueue messages
[X] Dequeue messages in discord bot
[X] Figure out command format
    - I know I can pass options, but how do I do cron syntax cleanly?
[ ] Better logging
    - Can winston determine process name?
[ ] Metrics
    - Open source version of data dog?
