Todo

* - Priority
  
  [X] Build new service
    [X] Store timings
    [X] In memory cache of timings
    [X] Create cron jobs to spawn messages
   [X] Refresh cache on process restart
        - Why didn't I do this earlier?
        - Maybe refactor into better abstraction, just in memory cache
    [X] Edit: Should probably merge the API into the lyrics-service one
              Idk what to name it, kinda combines two concerns I guess
              This would let me use the same db connection/schema
              Maybe consider using nest to have a rock solid API layer
              But that would also mean all cron jobs are running in same thread
              Multithread?
  [X] Setup Storage
  [X] Enqueue messages
  [X] Dequeue messages in discord bot
  [X] Figure out command format
      - I know I can pass options, but how do I do cron syntax cleanly?
  [X] Better internal deps: packages?
      - Should internals be packages? Pain to `npm i` every repo, probably wrong
  [X] Better split services: app, discord, lyrics-runner
  [X] Robustness
    - Discord bot needs help protecting itself
  [ ] Better logging
    - Can winston determine process name?
  [X] Metrics
    - Open source version of data dog?
    - May be more work than value, get some sense of scale
  [X] - Load schedules from memory
  [X] - Discord cron input
  [X] - Buffer random lyrics
  [ ] - ~Build bot website~
  [ ] - Build better readme

Containers - How to build dumb stuff faster
[X] - Single container
  [X] - Docker file
  [X] - Supervisor? pm2
        - Can this be a generic unix program?
  [ ] - Deploy to paas
[X] - Move to managed db
  [ ] - Can I move queue to same solution?
