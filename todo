Reoccurring Lyrics

Discord bot
  - new commands:
    - enable/disable reocurring messages
    - set cron time

Storage
  - new tables:
    - discordChannel
    - cronJob (describes the time to activate)
      - 1:M CronJob -> Channel

Service
  - probably need a new service for managing cronjobs
  - needs to be persisted and in memory



# Big Idea!

Timing Service
  - api
    - endpoint to create new timing
    - endpoint to create webhook (optional since internal)
  - acts like an in memory cache w/ persistance
    - on startup, load all timings into memory
  - when a job fires, send it to the caller (likely only discord bot)
  
- should I use webhooks or create jobs in rabbitmq?
